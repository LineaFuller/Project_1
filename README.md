# Project 1

## Background and Purpose

The Climate Crisis is one of the most consequential issues facing society as a result of human's increased use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and intensive agriculture rising the global temperature. It's important to note that temperature increase is not linear but will continue to increase unless greenhouse gases are curbed immediately. Scientists worry that we only have a few more years left until the tempertature's reach a tipping point sparking a positive-feedback loop creating an unihabitable Earth. 

Is the Earth warming? 

Although the warming of Earth is a scientific concensus, many people do not believe in it. In order to defentively answer the question, our group decided to investigate the global rise in temperature from a data driven standpoint. 

For this project, our group tracked global temperatures and precipitation levels over a time period to investigate a possible change. We pulled data from the Climate Data API that provides climate data derived from 15 global circulation models. GCM's are a type of climate model designed to forecast weather patterns and climate change in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The data includes two variables; temperature and precipitation measurements that can be collected by a monthly average or yearly average, and be paired with past and future time periods. 


## Procedure

Our group collectively parsed through the API utilizng python and successfully navigting github. We pulled the yearly average temperature (C) and precipitation (mm) rates from 1901 to 2012 in the US, Australia, and Brazil. The choosen countries consist of varying longitude and latitudes to compare climates in the northern hemishphere, southern hemisphere, and within the equatorial zone. After properly cleaning 
and constructing dataframes; the following comparisions were graphed and statistically analyzed across all three countries... 

-time versus precipitation

-time versus temperature

-temperature versus precipitation. 

Our group created insightful visualizations and calculated the r-values using the linear regression model to investigate possible correlations between the variables.
